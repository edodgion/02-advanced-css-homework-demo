# 02-Advanced-Css-Homework-Demo

In this weeks homework we were given the chance to start building a responsive and fuctional portfolio to carry over into the job market! In my porfolio I have included a big bold header with my name clear as day. A current profile picture of myself along with some facts about myself, goals and aspirations for my future as a developer.  I have also included some pictures of life in the real world. From there I have included some recent applications and a section 'Coming Soon' for links to future projects as I build and devlop this porfolio. Last in my footer I have included several ways to contact me via email, social media, LinkedIn, GitHub and even a direct phone line.  As fas as advenced CSS techniques I have utilized my skills with flexbox, hovering effects directed in my navigation and deployed application links.  The page has also been made reponsive in the viewport.
